## About

ActivEar is an web app that continuously records, transfers, and transcribes data from the user. It transforms audio data from the users microphone into text which is then stored as embeddings in a vector database. When the user asks a question, ActivEar searches and finds the relevant data and uses GPT to provide helpful answers.
